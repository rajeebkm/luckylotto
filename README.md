## Smart Contracts  
The smart contracts are written in Solidity and handle the following functionalities:  
- Game mechanics (dice rolls, coin flips, wheel spins).  
- Bet placements and payouts.  
- Ensuring transparency and fairness through on-chain randomness.  

Contracts are located in the `contracts` directory. Key files include:  
- `LuckyDiceRoll.sol`
